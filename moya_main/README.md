# MOYA - Meta Orchestration framework for Your Agents

MOYA is a reference implementation of our research paper titled "Engineering LLM Powered Multi-agent Framework for Autonomous CloudOps". The framework provides a flexible and extensible architecture for creating, managing, and orchestrating multiple AI agents to handle various tasks autonomously.

Preprint of the paper can be accessed at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08243).

## Features

- **Agent Management**: Create, register, and manage multiple AI agents.
- **Orchestration**: Orchestrate conversations and tasks across multiple agents.
- **Memory Tools**: Integrate memory tools to maintain conversation context and history.
- **Streaming Responses**: Support for streaming responses from agents.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the framework with new agents, tools, and orchestrators.

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install moya-ai  # Only core framework
pip install moya-ai[all] # All the supported services such as OpenAI, Bedrock, Ollama, Crewai
# or install specific ones - for example openai and ollama
pip install moya-ai[openai, ollama]
```
